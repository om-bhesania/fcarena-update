                        <p className="mb-6">We kindly inform our customers that cancellation requests must be submitted no later than 12 hours prior to the booked slot. Any cancellation request made within 12 hours of the scheduled slot cannot be accommodated. To ensure cancellation, please initiate your request with a minimum of 12 hours notice before the reserved slot. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</p>
